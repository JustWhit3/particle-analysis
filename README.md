# Useful Informations (Work in Progress)

## General Informations
This project has been created in 2016-2017 with my collegue Marco Collesei, for the exam "Laboratorio 2" of the bachelor's degree.
 
## List of the folders in the repository

- [Explanations](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Particle-class/tree/master/Explanations): this folder contains all the documents related to the explanations of the analysis from a physical point of
view. In this, you will not find explicit references to the code or to the technical aspects of the project, but only theoretical explanations. If someone is interested to see right away the complete explanation of the program and the final results, the link is [here](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Particle-class/blob/master/Explanations/What_my_program_does.md).

- [How-to guides](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Particle-class/tree/master/How-to%20guides): this folder contains all the guides necessary to execute the program in your device and to reproduce the same simulation in your dataset.

- [Project](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Particle-class/tree/master/Project): this folder contains the whole code of the project and some graphs and informations related to the representation of the final results. Quick link to the program is [here](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Particle-class/blob/master/Project/Program.ipynb).

- [Reference Guides](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Particle-classtree/master/Reference%20guides): this folder contains all the reference guides related to understand how work all the functions and classes defined in the project.

NOTE: for each folder there is a proper README.md file that explains in detail what are the documents inside it and what they do.
